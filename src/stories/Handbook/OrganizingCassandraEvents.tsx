        If you are an organiser for another meetup group that isnâ€™t exclusively
        about Cassandra but you are facilitating Cassandra-focused topics, then
        we would still love to promote your events to the Cassandra community.
        You can submit event details via this form, and we will add them to the
        central events calendar.
